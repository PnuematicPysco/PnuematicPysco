Hi, I am new to github, idk if people actually do this README thing or how people do it. coding, circuits and engineering is my hobbie. 
I just kinda started this on a whim, because I wanted to do a specific project.
I recently played retro fps games like final doom and doom 64 that were good quality. 
Something that bugged me was that there was not a game (or at least one I know of) that is a open, retro, zombie fps.
I like the style of a 2d images on a 3d plane like in doom. I have a current prototype of a engine in html and javascript, but I have yet to test it.
I am going to put it on github soon and hopefully people make suggestions and pull requests to improve it. 
I am good at coding but not level desgin, so i need some tips on that. 
idk when I am going to get around to start working on the level design or art of the game.
